## Version History Summary

| Version | Release Date | Status | Key Features |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| 1.0.0 | 2024-12-01 | Current | Production ready, +47% performance |
| 0.9.0 | 2024-01-15 | Previous | Initial public release |
| 0.8.0 | 2023-12-01 | Pre-release | Prototype version |

## Upgrade Guide

### From 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

1. **Token Type Changes**: Review any code that directly references token type constants
2. **Pool Usage**: Always use `defer` when returning objects to pools
3. **Import Paths**: Update imports from test packages if used
4. **Performance**: Expect 47% performance improvement, adjust timeouts accordingly

### Breaking Changes in 1.0.0

- Token type constants have been reorganized to prevent collisions
- Some internal APIs have been refactored for better performance
- Test helper functions have been updated
