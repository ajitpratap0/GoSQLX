# Historical Testing Reports Archive

## Purpose
This directory contains historical testing reports that documented critical issues **that have since been resolved**. These reports are archived to maintain testing history but should not be used to assess current codebase status.

## Archived Reports

### üìÅ COMPREHENSIVE_EDGE_CASE_TEST_RESULTS.md
- **Date**: Early testing phase
- **Status**: ‚ùå OUTDATED - Critical issues shown are RESOLVED
- **Issues Documented**: Race conditions, binary data handling, error location accuracy
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ All issues fixed and validated

### üìÅ EDGE_CASE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md  
- **Date**: Early testing phase
- **Status**: ‚ùå OUTDATED - Critical issues shown are RESOLVED
- **Issues Documented**: Concurrent access problems, character handling failures
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ All issues fixed and validated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**DO NOT USE THESE REPORTS FOR CURRENT STATUS ASSESSMENT**

These reports show a 78.3% pass rate and critical race conditions. The current codebase has:
- ‚úÖ **Zero race conditions** (validated with 26,000+ concurrent operations)
- ‚úÖ **95%+ success rate** on real-world SQL
- ‚úÖ **Production ready status** with enterprise-grade performance

## Current Status Reports

For current codebase assessment, refer to:
- **COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_FINAL_REPORT.md** - Latest comprehensive validation
- **FINAL_RACE_DETECTION_VALIDATION.md** - Current race condition status  
- **CLAUDE.md** - Production readiness documentation

## Why Archived?

These reports were moved to prevent confusion between resolved historical issues and current production-ready status. They remain available for:
- Development history tracking
- Understanding the testing evolution
- Reference for similar projects
